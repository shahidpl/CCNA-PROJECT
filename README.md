I'm currently preparing for my CCNA 200-301 Exam. During the preparation, I build some labs on various topics of Networking with the help of Cisco Packet Tracer.  I hope, these labs will help you too during your preparations.

LAB 1:
>>>> In this VLAN LAB, 2 VLANs are created. Black & Blue. S3 & S4 are connected with Trunk Links. 
>>>> PC0 - PC2 & PC1 - PC3 can communicate across the switches.

LAB2:
>>>> Static Routes has been setup between Router1 & Router 0.
>>>> To Communicate between VLAN 10 & VLAN 20, ROAS(Router on a Stick) is implemented.

LAB 3:
>>>> Router 0,1,2 & 3 are connected with RIP (Routing Information Protocol) 
>>>> All three networks 172.18.1.0, 10.2.1.0, 192.168.10.0 can communicate with each other using RIP

LAB 4:
>>>> IPV6 addresses are used (2001:0db8:0:0::/64) Range
>>>> Static Routes are added via Router 15's G0/1/0 interface.
>>>> Floating Route on Router 15 added via interface G0/0

LAB 5:
>>>> OSPF is implemented between all five routers in this LAB. 
>>>> Routers are having Router ID (1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, 3.3.3.3, 4.4.4.4 and 5.5.5.5)

LAB 6:
>>>> HSRP(Hot Standby Routing Protocol) is implemented between Router0 & Router1.
>>>> A virtual Router with IP Address of 10.1.1.4 /24 is also been setup.
>>>> Router1 is Active and Router0 is on Standby to take over in case of any failures.

LAB 7:
>>>> A simple TACACS+ implementation has been done.
>>>> Router is acting as a TACACS Client while server is providing authentication Services.

LAB 8:
>>>> In this implementation of WPA2 PSK, I have created a simple Wireless LAN where AP0, AP1 & AP2 are connected from Backbone Network (Switch 0). 
>>>> Each Access Point is running WIFI on different Channels to remove Overlapping. Each AP is also configured with different Security Settings.

LAB 9: 
>>>> In this lab, I demonstrated the use of access control lists and how can they allow and deny certain types of traffic.
>>>> Extended Access Lists are deployed.

LAB 10:
>>>> GRE Tunnel0 established between Router0 and Router1.
